## Installation

Installing the Webp plugin can be done in one of three ways:
- GPM (Grav Package Manager)
- manual method
- admin method

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

To install the plugin via the [GPM](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm), through your system's terminal (also called the command line),
navigate to the root of your Grav-installation, and enter:

    bin/gpm install webp

This will install the Webp plugin into your `/user/plugins`-directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/webp`.

### Manual Installation

To install the plugin manually, download the zip-version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`.
Then rename the folder to `webp`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/greenrivers/grav-plugin-webp) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/webp

> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which may require other plugins to operate,
> please see its [blueprints.yaml-file on GitHub](https://github.com/greenrivers/grav-plugin-webp/blob/master/blueprints.yaml).

### Admin Plugin

If you use the Admin Plugin, you can install the plugin directly by browsing the `Plugins`-menu and clicking on the `Add` button.

## Requirements
